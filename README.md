# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The main webpage will just include a few bullet points of information about myself, a section to add two numbers and a joke generator.



## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

To view and interact with the website either navigate to the website at
http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html

Or in vscode open the live preview via the square icon with the magnifying glass at the top right.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

Debugging and code modification can be done in real time while viewing the webpage. This can be done by clicking the icon on the left with the play button and the bug and then clicking debug.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```
